# Ecommerce-SQL-Analysis


This project demonstrates a practical application of SQL for analyzing real-world E-commerce data. It showcases my ability to design relational databases, write advanced SQL queries, and extract meaningful business insights.

# Project Overview

In this project, I designed a database schema and imported authentic E-commerce data from Kaggle. Using SQL, I performed detailed analysis to understand customer behavior, sales performance, delivery efficiency, and product satisfaction.

This work reflects both my technical expertise and my ability to translate data into actionable insights.

# Project Files

- **ecommerce_schema.sql** — database schema containing tables for customers, orders, products, payments, and reviews.  
- **Customer Analysis.sql** — SQL queries for analyzing and deriving insights from the dataset.

# Key Highlights

- Designed and implemented a normalized relational database schema  
- Imported and processed real E-commerce data  
- Wrote SQL queries to answer critical business questions, including:
  - Customer order distribution by state
  - Revenue generation and top-performing product categories
  - Average delivery times and efficiency analysis
  - Customer satisfaction measured through review scores

# How to Run

1. Create the database in MySQL:
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE ecommerce_analysis;
    USE ecommerce_analysis;
    ```
2. Load the schema file:
    ```sql
    SOURCE ecommerce_schema.sql;
    ```
3. Load the analysis queries:
    ```sql
    SOURCE "Customer Analysis.sql";
    ```

# Example Insights

From this analysis, the following insights were uncovered:
- Top states in terms of order volume
- Total revenue including shipping charges
- Best-selling product categories
- Average delivery time per order
- Average customer review score
