# Ecommerce-SQL-Analysis
It is a basic  SQL-based analysis of an E-commerce data set. I have designed the database schema (ecommerce_schema.sql) to create tables such as customers, orders, products, payments, and reviews. I then created some analysis queries (ecommerce_analysis.sql) to investigate customer trends, sales trends, delivery performance, and review scores.
